# React + Redux + React Router

Setup for React+Redux apps with example of async actions. It's just a setup which allows you to develop and deploy app without pain. It's not a bare minimum, although I tried to keep things simple.

## Scripts

Start **Express** (for production)

```bash
npm start
```

Start **WebpackDevServer** (for development)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build (also run in *postinstall*)

```bash
npm run build
```
